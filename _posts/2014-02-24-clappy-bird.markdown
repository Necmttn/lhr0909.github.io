So I assume most of you know about Flappy Bird by now, legendary app, crazy drama, mad clones, etc.  So earlier last week, on a Wednesday (or Thursday), one of my coworkers, Jiho, shared this idea: What if we make Flappy Bird, but we have to clap to get the bird to jump (aka *Clappy* Bird)?

Damn, that sounds cool. I decided to join him for the development, as a Mini Ludum Dare challenge. On Friday evening, we started the development. I proposed to use LibGDX because it provides pretty nice wrappers for just about everything you need to develop a game, and it has cross-platform support. Instead of making our own physics simulation, collision detection, etc., I picked Box2D as our base, and made the whole clone of Flappy Bird Prototype within the night. Was pretty fun!

The next day, our other coworker came in with some sound detection libs and we had a simple clapper going. Here is the Youtube Video for the working prototype with clapping:

This is pretty snazzy, isn't it? Here comes better. Today, we got some of our designer friends of Jiho, and we have some very very nice graphics for the game. After fighting with putting them on top of our prototype for hours (and my laptop just wouldn't run Eclipse properly, so I was trying to fix it for the whole afternoon before I gave up), here are some graphics:

This has been really fun! I haven't been this excited about programming for a very long time, and this really brings me back and makes me want to play with it a lot more.

Thanks everyone who participated the project, especially Jiho for making this happen!

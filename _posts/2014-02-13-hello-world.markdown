I think I am going to start blogging for various things I do on my computer, just to collect some thoughts, be it website design, be it game design, be it Starcraft/Hearthstone, or even poker. I want to start writing something for record, and github page + jekyll seems to suit me the best because it was easy to do and I have a ton of freedom on things.

Will see you guys a lot more often soon.

Cheers,
Simon

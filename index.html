        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey my name is Simon, a software developer currently working at Amazon.
            I enjoy writing code, recently more into JavaScript,
            regardless of client-side or server-side.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also love eSports! I play StarCraft II for my company competing at AHGL,
            and I have also been playing lots of Hearthstone since I had beta access.
        </p>
        <p>
            I picked up poker as a hobby when I graduated and started working,
            so I have been playing quite a bit of poker for the past year and a half :P
        </p>

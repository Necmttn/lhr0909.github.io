        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey my name is Simon, a software developer currently working at Amazon.
            I enjoy writing code, recently more into JavaScript,
            regardless of client-side or server-side.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy competition. The thrill and pressure coming from various competitions
            keep me going. I try to make time to play Texas Hold'em,
            or Competitive eSports title such as Hearthstone and StarCraft II, both of which
            I have reached higher levels competitively. I participate in
            <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam">Google Code Jams</a>
            every year because I rarely get to "compete" in the programming field, and I take
            every chance I get.
